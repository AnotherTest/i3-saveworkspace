#Save i3 workspaces

This very hacky and incomplete script saves your i3 workspaces to a file.
Later, it is possible to load that file and build up the workspace.

##Dependencies

* Tested and written with Python 2.7. Python 3 might (not) work.
* The i3 window manager.
* The py-i3 library.

##Todo

* Support for resized windows.
* Use command-line options instead of prompting for input.
* Cleanup the hacky code.
* Find and fix bugs!
